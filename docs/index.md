- **Session metadata**: Timestamp, ID, project name, summary, end reason
- **Duration**: Wall-clock time from start to end (seconds)
- **Activity**: User messages, assistant messages
- **Tokens**: Input, output, cache read, cache write, total
- **Cost**: Estimated USD based on Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing
- **Tools**: Tool call counts, API time, average call time, top 5 tools
- **Context**: Git branch, Claude Code version, permission mode

## Hook Feedback

The PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks can provide feedback when they block operations or detect issues:

**Security Block:**
```
🔒 BLOCKED: Access to sensitive file '.env'
   This file matches a security pattern and cannot be accessed.
```

**Cost Warning:**
```
💰 COST WARNING: Session approaching budget limit
   Tool: WebSearch (expensive operation)
```

**Quality Violation:**
```
⚠️  Code Quality Warning: src/api.php
   Linter: phpcs
   Line 42: Missing function docblock
```

Note: SessionStart and SessionEnd hooks log data in the background. Check `~/.claude/session-logs/sessions.csv` to view your session history.

## Privacy & Security

**What's logged:**
